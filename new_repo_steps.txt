Git repo steps

echo "# something" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:adwaitjoshi009/something.git
git push -u origin main


Some important git commands
git remote -v                       tells origin 
git restore --staged .              unstages tracked files
git log --name-status Head^..Head   see previous commit
git log -1                          shows only one previous commit. -2 shows two and so on. 
git show                            previous commit.

angular cli setup:

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-app
ng new my-app --create-application=false for empty workspace, no default app

to be easier for the first time, no strict mode:
ng new my-app --no-strict
ng serve -o

***********************************************************************************************

to add external packages or modules, import them in ngModule
import any module by import statement in app.module.ts --> add in imports []

***********************************************************************************************

.DS_store file was bothering everytime, so needed to be added to gitignore:

touch ~/.gitignore
git config --global core.excludeFiles ~/.gitignore

be careful what patterns you choose to ignore globally

to add any file to gitignore:

$ echo example.file >> .gitignore

revise cat command once

cat ~/.gitignore 
gave contents of gitignore on console

***********************************************************************************************
npm install bootstrap@3 --save
installing bootstrap --> adding to styles [] in angular.json (path of bootstrap min css from
bootstrap dist folder)
if introduced in styles.css, any css becomes global for the app.

***********************************************************************************************

Journey of angular component

it all starts with index.html. index.html is served --> scripts in it visible when inspected in browser -->
they start basically the angular app-->  main.ts -->platformBrowserDynamic method followed by bootstrapModule and appModule is 
passed to it --> appModule has an array that contains components that would be analysed when angular is looking at 
index.html --> then angular understands that app-root selector in index.html is coming from app.Component.html -->
as it was in bootstrap [] in appModule

so the journey: main.ts --> appModule --> bootstrap[] --> appComponent --> it's selector in index.html is parsed
--> then app.Component.html all is inserted into index.html.

So the task for angular was to recognize what actually that <app-root> is.

also, that loading... within app-root tag in index.html gets overridden at runtime with code in
app.component.html, as angular is js framework, that manipulates dom at runtime

***********************************************************************************************

components

appComponent will include our other components
index.html will only contain appComponent, no other component

@Component decorator
decorators decorate classes, add metadata --> helps angular know what to do with that class
eg. @Component decorator will tell angular that this class is a component, @ngModule decorator
will say this class is an angular module

also, just declaring a decorator is not enough, we'd have to pass it with js object, which contains
that additional info or meta-data, which will help angular decide what to do with that class

@Component, where it's coming from will ask the typescript. Typescript wants to know everything.
So, we'd have to import it from @angular/core. It is a module. Angular is made up of various modules.

also, in import statements, extension .ts is not required.

***********************************************************************************************

app.module.ts

bootstrap[] tells angular which component to look for when starting, so that index.html selector
will be parsed

imports[] tells which modules are to be imported, for angular to function
browserModule is required to run angular in browser

components build webpages and modules bundle together different pieces into packages

modules tell which features angular will be able to use

angular, by default will not scan all of your files, that's where app.module helps.
we don't add more components into index.html, so to add more components, we gotta add or register them
in declarations[] so that angular will know which components to look for.

***********************************************************************************************

Nested component:
ng generate component component_name
ng g c component_name

so, a new component from CLI can be created from a new terminal, not touching the running ngserve
newly created component can be nested inside another component.

***********************************************************************************************

Inline templates:
instead of using templateUrl, an html inline template (with lesser html elements) can be directly
written inside component.ts file.

***********************************************************************************************

inline styling:
in component's ts file, styleUrl is, unline templateUrl, an array that can contain multiple urls to
style files.

inline styling, if it's brief and doesn't need a separate styling file, can be defined as
styles = [`array of strings`]

note: component.styles.css trumps or is global styling, overrides component.html styling if any, but styles [] of strings
from ts file trumps or overrides everything, thus acts as global.


***********************************************************************************************

Data binding:

data binding is the communication between component.ts file and the respective template.

Types:
- string interpolation {{ data }} -- output data
- property binding [property]="data" -- output data
- even binding (event) => "expression" -- react to user events.
- two way binding [ngModel]="data"

String interpolation: {{ component_variable}} or {{ 'any expression that'll resolve to the string' }}
-even a method can be called {{ method }}, which should return a string though.

-no multiline expressions or block expressions like if, else.
-number is converted to string in it.


can a function that returns a string be included in the string interpolation data binding? what about block expressions like if-else?
what about multiline expressions?

Property binding:
- changes dom at runtime
- [] tells angular that it is going to be property binding.
- can propertybinding be done with directives and components? (yes)
- [disabled]="any ts expression or class property"

- When to use property binding and when to go for string interpolation:
=> when you want a string returned in a template, string interpolation.
=> when you want to change an html property or a component or a directive, property binding.

Event binding:
when user does something, an event gets triggered. Maybe mouse movement, click, etc.
Then we have to change the data or communicate with the template.
Then go for event binding.
(any_event)="ts code"
ts code can be written inside "" instead of a function, but that'd be verbose sometimes, so
a function is preferable to be executed when an event is triggered.

- which properties and events can be bound?
all of them. Just google your_html_element properties and events for your_html_element.

Passing and using data with event binding:
input event
$event object: emits the data that's been input. Fetches the event data, inshort.
bootstrap form-control class for input
event.target shows the element on which the event took place.
event.target.value shows it's value, ie entered input, for ex.

why did we have to use <HTMLInputElement>.event.target?
what does any anyHtmlElement.event show us?


Two-way binding:
for this we'll need ngModel directive
we introduce new directives by importing them inside app.module.ts file
into the imports[]
ngModel directive is inside formsModule, which in turn is inside @angular/forms.

- two way binding is the combination of event and property binding.
- the preproduced data can be shown as input as well as user input or user triggered event can
change the data too.
[(ngModel)="class_property"] is an example. Here [] and () show that property and event binding
is combined here in the two way binding

for example, in our input element
in place of input event which is (input) and the handler that is, the function to run when the 
event is fired, we did [(ngModel)]="component property"
here, both event and property binding is taking place.
